## 📌 Project Overviews

### 1. Detection of Covid‑19 Using Lung Ultrasound
- **Objective**: Classify lung ultrasound videos/images into COVID‑19, pneumonia, or healthy categories.
- **Method**: Used CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT) models for frame-level and video-level classification. Frames were extracted (~152 per video), resized, and augmented for training.
- **Results**:
  - CNN (image-level): ~86.7%
  - CNN (video-level): ~82.6%
  - ViT (image-level): ~82.4%
  - ViT (video-level): ~55.3%

### 2. Construction-Based Building Recognition (Hackathon Project)
- **Objective**: Detect construction progress and mismatches by comparing site images to building plans.
- **Approach**: Used image processing and feature-matching to analyze structural differences.

### 3. IBM Internship Project: Movie Recommendation System
- **Objective**: Develop a collaborative filtering-based movie recommender system.
- **Details**: User history was used to suggest similar movies using matrix factorization techniques.

### 4. Voice of Emotions for Improved Speech Analysis
- **Objective**: Classify emotions in speech using deep learning models.
- **Approach**: Implemented CNNs and RNNs on labeled emotional speech datasets to detect emotional tone in audio clips.

### 5. Python Full Stack
- **Content**: Contains full-stack web development exercises and mini-projects using Python and JavaScript.
- **Structure**: Typically includes Python backends and HTML/JavaScript-based frontends for small applications.
